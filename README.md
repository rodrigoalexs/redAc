Test PHP Developer (Laravel)

Thank you for the chance to show my skills.

In order to run this project please:

  - Create a database and give the system access to it through the file .env
  - Run the migrations in order to create the tables.
  - Run composer update in order to install all necessary dependencies.
  - Include credentials to a mail sender. I've used the following:
     - MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
     - MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
     - MAIL_PORT=2525
     - MAIL_USERNAME=8fdd058dc9a620
     - MAIL_PASSWORD=6d6193d1072a8a
     - MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=from@example.com
     - MAIL_FROM_NAME=Example
     - MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null 
  
  Thank you
